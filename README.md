🤖 Multi-Agent AI Demos

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating various AI agents built using different models and tools, including Groq, LLaMA, and OpenAI. These agents are designed for different use cases like simple interaction, finance-related analysis, and collaborative team-based tasks.

📄 Files Overview

1_simple_groq_agent.py

🧠 A basic agent implementation using the Groq architecture.

Good starting point for understanding how to build lightweight conversational agents.

2_finance_agent_llama.py

💰 A domain-specific agent for financial data analysis, powered by LLaMA models.

Capable of parsing financial text, making inferences, or assisting with investment reasoning.

3_agent_teams_openai.py

👥 An example of a team-based agent system using OpenAI's APIs.

Simulates multiple agents collaborating on a shared task (e.g., planning, Q&A, creative tasks).

🚀 How to Run
